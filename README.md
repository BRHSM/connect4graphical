The project description is as follows: 

The game of connect4 is famous for being both very easy to get into as well as complex enough to be enjoyable for more experienced players. The game works as follows: A board contains a matrix of tiles (with 6 rows and 7 columns) on which a player can change the color of 1 tile to the color corresponding to their player (player 1 is red, player 2 is yellow). The player chooses a column and the lowest white tile changes to the player's color, then the other player does the same. This goes on until one of the players creates a line of 4 tiles directly adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The goal of this project is to create a version of the connect4 game which includes a graphical interface.

A standard game of connect4 is played with a board containing 7 columns and 6 rows, to make the program more versatile and more interesting to develop, I've chosen to allow the players to set these numbers to different amounts. The number of rows and columns are inserted before the game starts as well as both players' names.
